# Headwind

Headwind is an opinionated Tailwind CSS class sorter for Visual Studio Code. It enforces consistent ordering of classes by parsing your code and reprinting class tags to follow a given order.

**[Get it from the VS Code Marketplace â†’](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=heybourn.headwind)**

# Usage

You can install Headwind via the VS Code Marketplace, or package it yourself using [vsce](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension). Headwind works globally once installed and can be triggered by:

* Pressing CMD + Shift + T on Mac
* Pressing CTRL + ALT + T on Windows
* Running 'Sort Tailwind CSS Classes' via the Command Palette

Performing one of these actions will automatically sort all classes within an opened document. Any custom/unknown classes will be moved to the end of the class list.

# Customisation

Headwind ships with a default class order (located in [package.json](package.json)). You can edit this to your liking on the extension settings page.

### `headwind.sortTailwindClasses`:

A string array that determines the default sort order.

### `headwind.classRegex`:

A string that determines the default regex to search a class attribute.
The default is set to `\bclass(?:Name)*\s*=\s*([\"\']([_a-zA-Z0-9\s\-\:]+)[\"\'])` but can be customized to fit your needs.

Make sure if a new group is created that this is non-capturing by using `(?:)`.
